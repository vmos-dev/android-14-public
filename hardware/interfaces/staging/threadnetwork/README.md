# Staging threadnetwork HAL interface

The directory includes the unstable/unreleased version of `hardware/interfaces/threadnetwork`
code which should **NOT** be used in production. But vendors may start verifying their hardware
with the HAL interface.

This directory will be cleaned up when the stable Thread HAL interface is added in
`hardware/interfaces/threadnetwork` by version `V` or later.
